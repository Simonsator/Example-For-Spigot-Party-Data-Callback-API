# Example For The Party Data Callback API Of Party And Friends Extended Edition For BungeeCord
## What is the party data callback api?
The party data callback api allows your spigot plugin to use the party data of [Party and Friends Extended Edition for Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/party-and-friends-extended-edition-for-bungeecord-velocity-supports-1-7-1-16-4.10123/). Unlike the [Spigot Party API for Party and Friends Extended](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigot-party-api-for-party-and-friends-extended-redisbungee-requiered.39751/) you are not required to use Redis, but you are more limited using this api. The only requirment is that the gui has to be installed on the spigot server where you want to receive the data using this api.
## What are the limitations of the callback api?
As the name suggests it uses a callback (The class de.simonsator.partyandfriendsgui.api.datarequest.party.PartyDataCallBackRunnable). This means the data won't be accessible directly when you request it using the api, but you are going to have to wait until the spigot server receives the data from the bungeecord. When the data is received the method onCallback(pPlayer: Player, pParty: PartyData, pId: int) is called. Your data handling must be done in this class. Also, this api is read only and the data won't be updated automatically when for example somebody leaves the party. The [Spigot Party API for Party and Friends Extended](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigot-party-api-for-party-and-friends-extended-redisbungee-requiered.39751/) on the other hand has not those limitations, as it uses Redis to constantly sync the data.
